# SAV - Sorting Algorithms Visualized

The idea is to develop a visual program that shows how an array is being sorted

Written using C and SDL2 library for graphics

# Quick start
```console
$ make
$ ./sav
```

You can change the sorting algorithm by setting the varible "sel\_algo" in the main function

(in a future this will be done by parsing command line arguments)
